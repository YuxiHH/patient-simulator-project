# Clinical Scenario

## 1. Lab Result Explanation

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "lab": {
    "name": "Creatinine",
    "value": 1.9,
    "unit": "mg/dL",
    "ref_low": 0.6,
    "ref_high": 1.2,
    "flag": "H",
    "date": "2025-10-12"
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** confusion about “creatinine”; underestimating severity (“a little high is fine”); timeline confusion.
* **Simulation goals:** low literacy + mild anxiety → trigger requests for clarification or analogy.
* **Prompt keys:** `literacy_level=low`, `numeracy_level=low`, `emotion_state=anxious`, `knowledge_gap=lab_terms`
* **Escalation:** if acute symptoms or critical value appear → mark *refer to clinician*.

## 2. Radiology Findings

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "imaging": {
    "modality": "CT Chest",
    "finding": "6 mm pulmonary nodule",
    "impression": "likely benign; follow-up in 12 months"
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** benign vs malignant confusion; interpreting “follow-up” as “no problem.”
* **Simulation goals:** moderate literacy + anxiety/fear; include causal confusion (“stress caused it”).
* **Prompt keys:** `emotion_state=anxious`, `reasoning_bias=causal_confusion`
* **Escalation:** repeated “Is it cancer?” with rising distress → add reassurance + uncertainty statement.

---

## 3. Pathology and Staging

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "pathology": {
    "site": "breast",
    "grade": "2",
    "stage": "pT2N0M0",
    "marker": { "ER": "+", "PR": "+", "HER2": "-" }
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** mixing grade vs stage vs biomarkers; wrong inference about therapy.
* **Simulation goals:** high information density → cognitive overload.
* **Prompt keys:** `info_complexity=high`, `overload_trigger=true`, `literacy=medium`
* **Escalation:** if treatment decision questions arise → respond neutrally (no advice).

---

## 4. Genetic Testing (Variant of Uncertain Significance)

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "genetics": {
    "gene": "BRCA1",
    "variant": "VUS",
    "note": "clinical significance uncertain; recommend family history review"
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** treating VUS as pathogenic; assuming relatives are at risk; probability misreads.
* **Simulation goals:** term confusion + high anxiety + risk misinterpretation + family concern.
* **Prompt keys:** `emotion_state=anxious`, `knowledge_gap=genetic_terms`, `numeracy_level=low`
* **Escalation:** requests for family testing → provide conceptual info only, *no clinical advice*.

## 5. Medication and Adherence

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "med": {
    "name": "Metformin",
    "dose": "500 mg",
    "freq": "BID",
    "indication": "T2DM"
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** wrong dose/frequency; conflict with culture/diet; fear of side effects.
* **Simulation goals:** language mismatch & cultural nuance prompting clarification.
* **Prompt keys:** `primary_language=Spanish`, `bilingual=true`, `cultural_context=Latin`
* **Escalation:** severe adverse reaction mentioned → flag *contact healthcare provider*.

---

## 6. Chemotherapy / Radiation Toxicities

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "therapy": {
    "type": "Chemo",
    "regimen": "FOLFOX",
    "cycle": 2,
    "adverse_events": ["nausea", "mild neuropathy"]
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** common side effects perceived as life-threatening; ignoring danger signs.
* **Simulation goals:** emotional dynamics (fear → denial → anger).
* **Prompt keys:** `emotion_state=anxious→anger`, `mood=irritable`
* **Escalation:** red-flag terms like “chest pain” or “shortness of breath” → immediate escalation.

---

## 7. Post-Surgery Follow-Up

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "surgery": {
    "procedure": "laparoscopic cholecystectomy",
    "date": "2025-10-01",
    "instructions": ["no heavy lifting 2 weeks"]
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** timeline/restriction confusion; overload.
* **Simulation goals:** include *teach-back* (“Can you say what you understood?”).
* **Prompt keys:** `literacy=low`, `ask_for_teachback=true`
* **Escalation:** if signs of complications or severe pain reported → *refer to clinician*.

---

## 8. Insurance / Financial Counseling

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "finance": {
    "item": "PET-CT",
    "coverage": "pre-authorization required",
    "copay": "$200"
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** “pre-authorization = denial”; anger or distrust.
* **Simulation goals:** tone mismatch and socioeconomic tension.
* **Prompt keys:** `emotion_state=angry`, `tone_mismatch=true`, `cultural_context=working_class`
* **Escalation:** if hostility escalates → de-escalation language + offer to connect billing support.

---

## 9. Clinical Trial Consent

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "trial": {
    "id": "NCTxxxx",
    "phase": "II",
    "randomization": true,
    "key_points": ["potential benefit unknown", "extra visits required"]
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** randomization seen as unfair; therapeutic misconception (trial = better care).
* **Simulation goals:** uncertainty communication and value trade-offs.
* **Prompt keys:** `numeracy=low`, `reasoning_bias=therapeutic_misconception`
* **Escalation:** hesitation/withdrawal → provide neutral procedural info only (no persuasion).

---

## 10. Prognosis / End-of-Life Conversations

**EHR Schema**

```json
{
  "prognosis": {
    "status": "uncertain",
    "recommendation": "discuss supportive care options"
  }
}
```

* **Typical misunderstandings:** population survival stats taken as personal fate; strong emotional swings.
* **Simulation goals:** emotional trajectory (anxiety → denial/hope/hopelessness).
* **Prompt keys:** `emotion_state=anxious→denial|hope|hopeless`, `safety_sensitive=true`
* **Escalation:** any despair or self-harm language → terminate simulation and escalate immediately.
